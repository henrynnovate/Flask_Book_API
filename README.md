**Book Management Web App**

This web application allows users to manage a collection of books. It consists of a frontend, backend API server, and a database.

**Frontend:**
- The frontend is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- It provides a user-friendly interface for adding, updating, and deleting books.
- Users can input book details such as title, author, publisher, and language.
- Book data is displayed in a list format, with options to delete or update each book.

**Backend API Server:**
- The backend API server is built using Flask, a Python web framework.
- It provides endpoints for performing CRUD operations on books.
- Endpoints include fetching all books, adding a new book, updating an existing book, deleting a book, and fetching a single book by its ID.
- The API server interacts with a MySQL database to store and retrieve book data.

**Database:**
- The application uses a MySQL database to persist book data.
- The database contains a table named 'books' with columns for the book's ID, title, author, publisher, and language.

**Deployment on Vercel:**
- Both the frontend files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and the backend Flask application are deployed on Vercel.
- The database is hosted separately, and the API server interacts with it via appropriate database drivers.
- Vercel provides hosting for static sites and serverless functions, making it suitable for hosting both the frontend and backend of this application.

To get started:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Set up the MySQL database and configure the Flask application to connect to it.
3. Deploy the frontend and backend to Vercel.
4. Access the web application through the provided Vercel URL.
